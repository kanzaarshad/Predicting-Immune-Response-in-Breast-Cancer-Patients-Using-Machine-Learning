The dataset includes:
- **Immune Checkpoint Markers**: PD-L1, CTLA-4 expression levels.
- **Immune Cell Populations**: CD4+, CD25+ T cells.
- **Genomic Data**: RNA sequencing, Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB).
- **Clinical Data**: Patient demographics, tumor subtypes, treatment history.
## Data Preprocessing
We apply the following steps to prepare the dataset:
1. **Gene Expression Transformation** - Log normalization and quantile normalization.
2. **Feature Scaling** - Standard scaling (Z-score) and Min-Max scaling.
3. **Handling Missing Data** - Multiple imputations; removing features with >30% missing values.
4. **Encoding Categorical Features** - One-hot and label encoding.
5. **Feature Engineering** -
   - **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** - Aggregates gene expression into pathway scores.
   - **Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)** - Computed as the number of mutations per megabase.

## Model Training
We train several machine learning models, including:
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Neural Networks**

Evaluation is performed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
